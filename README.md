### Abstract
This paper presents an in-depth exploration of Spatial Room Impulse Responses (SRIRs), focusing on three main objectives: the development of a Six-Degrees-of-Freedom (6DoF) SRIR dataset for binaural auralization with a moving listener, the exploration of a novel technique for SRIR interpolation, and the proposal of a novel evaluation method for SRIRs of non-uniform length. Our research contributes a refined SRIR dataset with dynamic measurements taken along a predefined trajectory, enhancing spatial resolution and providing valuable insights for applications in immersive audio, augmented reality, and sound localization. Additionally, we propose a novel Partial Optimal Transport (POT) methodology for signed SRIR interpolation, empirically evaluated by employing Interaural Cross-Correlation (IACC) as a metric post sound field reproduction. This technique is specifically designed to overcome the limitations inherent in traditional static discrete location auralization methods, aiming for a leap in the accuracy and efficiency of sound rendering. Furthermore, an evaluation method was developed to overcome the challenges of quantitatively assessing the quality of differ ently sized interpolated SRIRs based on temporal perception.
